Unzip into a directory.
In this directory, enter 'make' into terminal to compile the file
Then to call each function:
./diskinfo <NAME_OF_DISK>.IMA
./disklist <NAME_OF_DISK>.IMA
./diskget <NAME_OF_DISK>.IMA <NAME_OF_FILE_YOU_WISH_TO_COPY>.<EXT>
./diskput <NAME_OF_DISK>.IMA <SUBDIRECTORY>/<NAME_OF_FILE_YOU_WISH_TO_COPY>.<EXT>


I DO NOT KNOW WHY ./diskget ONLY RETURNS CORRUPTED PDF FILES. IT LITERALLY HAS THE EXACT NUMBER OF BYTES
AS IT'S SUPPOSED TO. PLEASE TELL ME WHY IVE LITERALLY BEEN CRYING FOR PAST 3 HOURS.

Diskput is not completed :(
